# dotfiles

⚙️ .files, such as .vimrc, for keeping tracking of my user specfic configuration.

## Getting Started

First we need to install Homebrew, which we will then use to install some other packages, including the most important toolm GNU Stow.

The instructions and script to install Homebrew can be found on their home page.

Once Homebrew is intstalled you can then install GNU Stow:

```bash
brew install stow
```

Because there is going to be potentially some configuration and script editing, the next thing to install is NeoVim.
